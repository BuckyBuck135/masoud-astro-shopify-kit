## Overview

This advanced kit combines a pre-configured <a href="https://www.astro.build">Astro</a> environment with headless Shopify integration using <a href="https://shopify.dev/docs/api/storefront-web-components">Storefront Web Components</a>. Built for developers who need a modern e-commerce solution with full frontend control, this kit leverages Shopify's robust backend for product management, inventory, payment processing and checkout, while giving you complete freedom over the frontend experience.

The kit also includes a [Decap CMS integration](https://decapcms.org/), allowing your clients to manage content like blog posts or photo galleries independently. Five starter pages built with <a href="https://codestitch.app/">CodeStitch's vanilla component library</a> are included, making it easy to swap sections and customize the design.

This kit gets e-commerce projects off the ground quickly, with deployment possible in minutes. We recommend Netlify as a host.

<a name="prerequisites"></a>

## Prerequisites

This is an advanced kit. You should have:

- **Required:** Solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Required:** Basic familiarity with Astro (components, layouts, routing)
- **Recommended:** Understanding of React-style components and props
- **Recommended:** Basic Shopify concepts (products, variants, collections)

Much of the complex integration work has been done for you, but familiarity with these technologies will help you customize and extend the kit.

[NOTE: this is a WIP, not even sure we should add it to be honest]
## 🛒 Is Shopify Right For You?

Before diving in, consider which e-commerce platform best fits your project needs. Here's a comparison of headless e-commerce solutions:

<a name="shopifyHeadless"></a>

### Shopify (Headless)

**Best for:** Feature-rich stores with 20+ products, clients who need Collections for product organization, inventory management, and plans to scale.

**Pricing:**
- **Starter Plan:** $5/month - Basic e-commerce with buy buttons and checkout links. 5% commission fee on card transactions.
- **Basic Plan:** $39/month - Includes Collections, custom domains, discount codes, and full Storefront API access. 1.5% commission fee on card transactions.

**Pros:**
- Complete commerce platform with robust backend
- Excellent documentation and large ecosystem
- Collections for organizing products

<a name="connectingToShopify"></a>

## Connecting to Shopify

This section provides a comprehensive guide to integrating Shopify with your Astro project using Storefront Web Components.

<a name="shopifyPartners"></a>

### Shopify Partners Program (Recommended)

Before starting e-commerce work, we recommend setting up a [Shopify Partners](https://www.shopify.com/partners) account to manage all your clients in one place. This can be done free of charge, and you can even earn money by referring clients to use Shopify and handing over stores.

**Benefits:**
- Manage multiple client stores from one dashboard
- Create unlimited development stores for testing
- Earn commissions when clients upgrade to paid plans
- Access to partner resources and support

**Getting Started with Partners:**

1. **Sign up for Shopify Partners** - Visit [shopify.com/partners](https://www.shopify.com/partners) and create a free account

2. **Create a development store** - Follow [this Shopify guide](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/managing-stores/development-stores) to create a development store for your client

3. **Earn commissions** - When you transfer the store to your client, you'll earn a [referral commission](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/how-to-earn#development-store-referrals) when they subscribe to a paid plan

**Note:** If you're building for a single client or already have a Shopify store, you can skip the Partners program and use a standard Shopify account.

<a name="shopifySetup"></a>

### Setup Steps

1. **Create or access your Shopify store**
   - If using Shopify Partners: Create a development store from your Partners dashboard
   - Or sign up at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) if using a standard account
   - Development stores are free during development (plan selection happens at client handoff)

2. **Install the Headless app**
   - Navigate to the [Headless app](https://apps.shopify.com/headless) in the Shopify App Store
   - Click "Add app" to install it on your store
   - This app provides the Storefront API access needed for headless commerce

3. **Generate your Storefront API access token**
   - In your Shopify admin, go to the Headless app
   - Navigate to the **Storefront API** tab
   - Click **Manage** to view your public access token
   - Copy the **Public access token** (this is safe to use in client-side code)

4. **Locate your Store Domain Name**
  - In your Shopify admin, go to **Settings**
  - Click on **Domains**, then copy your full domain name, including `https:`

5. **Configure your kit**
   - Open `src/data/shopify.ts` in your project
   - Update the following fields:
   ```typescript
   export const PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN = "your-token-here" // obtained in step 3
   export const PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN = "https://your-store.myshopify.com/" // obtained in step 4
   export const PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_COUNTRY = "US"
   export const PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_LANGUAGE = "en"
   ```

6. **Verify the connection**
   - Run `npm run dev`
   - Navigate to `/shop` on your local development server
   - You should see your Shopify products loading

<a name="shopifyIntegrationReference"></a>

## 📚 Shopify Integration Reference

This comprehensive reference covers all aspects of working with Shopify's Storefront Web Components in your Astro project.

<a name="understandingComponents"></a>

### 🧩 Understanding Storefront Web Components

Storefront Web Components are ready-to-use custom HTML elements that let you integrate Shopify functionality into any website by simply embedding HTML code. No GraphQL queries or complex API calls required.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Declarative HTML:** Just add custom HTML elements to your pages
- **Automatic data fetching:** Components fetch data from Shopify automatically
- **Built-in cart & checkout:** Cart and checkout functionality works out of the box
- **No build-time requirements:** Data is fetched at runtime, no static generation needed
- **Type-safe:** Full TypeScript support

**Resources:**
- **Playground:** [Try components interactively](https://webcomponents.shopify.dev/playground?view=editor)
- **Reference Docs:** [Complete component documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/storefront-web-components)

<a name="howItWorks"></a>

### ⚙️ How This Kit Works

Understanding the data flow helps you customize and extend the kit effectively:

1. **Store Provider Wrapper**
   - The `ShopifyStoreProvider.astro` component wraps your app with a `<shopify-store>` element
   - This provides store context (domain, access token, country, language) to all child components
   - Located in your layout or page files

2. **Runtime Data Fetching**
   - Unlike traditional headless setups, no GraphQL queries are needed at build time
   - Web Components fetch data from Shopify when the page loads
   - This means products are always up-to-date without rebuilding

3. **Product Listings**
   - The `/shop` page uses `<shopify-list-context>` to query and render multiple products
   - Supports pagination, filtering, and sorting
   - Uses a `<template>` element to define how each product card should look

4. **Product Detail Pages**
   - Dynamic routes (`/shop/[slug].astro`) use `<shopify-context>` to load individual products
   - Supports variant selection, add to cart, and buy now functionality
   - Includes loading placeholders for better UX

5. **Cart System**
   - Built-in Shopify cart components handle cart state
   - Checkout redirects to Shopify's secure checkout
   - No custom backend required

<a name="keyComponents"></a>

</details>

<a name="collections"></a>

### 🛍️ Collections

Collections are product groupings that help organize your store and make it easier to browse.

**What are Collections?**
- Groups of products organized by category, type, season, etc.
- Can be manually curated or automatically generated based on rules
- Help customers find related products
- Essential for stores with 20+ products

**Plan Requirements:**
- **Collections are available on Basic Plan and above**
- Not available on Starter Plan

**Creating Collections in Shopify:**
1. Log into your Shopify admin
2. Go to **Products > Collections**
3. Click **Create collection**
4. Choose manual (select products) or automated (define rules)
5. Add products and save

**Using Collections in Your Kit:**

Query collections in `<shopify-list-context>`:
```html
<shopify-list-context
  type="collection"
  query="collections"
  first="10">
  <template>
    <div class="collection-card">
      <h3><shopify-data query="collection.title"></shopify-data></h3>
      <shopify-data query="collection.description"></shopify-data>
    </div>
  </template>
</shopify-list-context>
```

Query products in a specific collection:
```html
<shopify-list-context
  type="product"
  query="collection(handle: 'summer-collection').products"
  first="12">
  <template>
    <!-- Product card markup -->
  </template>
</shopify-list-context>
```

<a name="cartCheckout"></a>

### 🛒 Cart & Checkout

**Adding Items to Cart:**

From `src/components/shopify/ShopifyAddToCartBtn.astro`:
```html
<button onclick="getElementById('cart').addLine(event).showModal();"
        shopify-attr--disabled="!product.selectedOrFirstAvailableVariant.availableForSale">
  Add to cart
</button>
```

**Buy Now (Skip Cart):**
```html
<button onclick="document.querySelector('shopify-store').buyNow(event)"
        shopify-attr--disabled="!product.selectedOrFirstAvailableVariant.availableForSale">
  Buy now
</button>
```

**Cart Component:**

The `ShopifyCart.astro` component uses `<shopify-cart-modal>` to display the cart:
```html
<shopify-cart-modal id="cart">
  <template>
    <!-- Cart UI markup -->
  </template>
</shopify-cart-modal>
```

**Cart Toggle Button:**

From `ShopifyCartToggleBtn.astro`:
```html
<button onclick="getElementById('cart').showModal()">
  Cart (<shopify-data query="cart.totalQuantity"></shopify-data>)
</button>
```

<a name="filtersSortingPagination"></a>

### 🔍 Filters, Sorting & Pagination

Manage large product catalogs with built-in filtering, sorting, and pagination.

#### Filters

**Requirements:**
- Shopify **Search & Discovery** app (free, built-in)
- Configure filters in your Shopify admin

**Setup:**
1. In Shopify admin, go to **Online Store > Preferences**
2. Find **Search & Discovery** app
3. Enable filters (price, availability, vendor, tags, product type, etc.)

**Using Filters:**

From `src/components/shopify/ShopifyFilterWrapper.astro`:
```html
<shopify-filters>
  <template>
    <button shopify-filter-option>
      <shopify-data query="option.label"></shopify-data>
    </button>
  </template>
</shopify-filters>
```

#### Sorting

From `src/components/shopify/ShopifySorting.astro`:
```html
<shopify-list-context sort-key="PRICE">
  <!-- Products sorted by price -->
</shopify-list-context>
```

**Available sort keys:**
- `TITLE` - Alphabetically by title
- `PRICE` - Low to high price
- `CREATED_AT` - Newest first
- `BEST_SELLING` - Most popular

#### Pagination

From `src/components/shopify/ShopifyPagination.astro`:
```html
<shopify-pagination>
  <button shopify-previous-page>Previous</button>
  <button shopify-next-page>Next</button>
</shopify-pagination>
```

Configure items per page in `<shopify-list-context>`:
```html
<shopify-list-context first="12">
  <!-- Shows 12 products per page -->
</shopify-list-context>
```

<a name="customizingComponents"></a>

### 🎨 Customizing Components

This kit's Shopify components can be customized with CSS and JavaScript.

#### Styling Components

**Standard CSS:**

Most components accept standard CSS classes:
```html
<shopify-media class="product-image"></shopify-media>
```

```css
.product-image img {
  border-radius: 8px;
  transition: transform 0.3s;
}

.product-image img:hover {
  transform: scale(1.05);
}
```

**Shadow DOM Parts:**

Some components use Shadow DOM. Style them with `::part()`:

```css
/* Style variant selector buttons */
shopify-variant-selector::part(radio) {
  padding: 0.5rem 0.875rem;
  font-size: 0.875rem;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
}
```

#### Sold Out Products

This kit includes styling for unavailable products. From `src/pages/shop/index.astro`:

```html
<article shopify-attr--disabled="!product.availableForSale">
  <!-- Product card -->
</article>
```

```css
.cs-item:is([disabled]) {
  cursor: not-allowed;
  position: relative;
}

.cs-item:is([disabled])::before {
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  z-index: 1;
}

.cs-item:is([disabled])::after {
  content: "Sold out";
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  font-size: 1.125rem;
  font-weight: 700;
  z-index: 2;
}
```

#### Customizing Cart Behavior

Modify cart actions in your components:

```javascript
// Add item and show cart
document.getElementById('cart').addLine(event).showModal();

// Update quantity
document.getElementById('cart').updateLine({ id: lineId, quantity: newQuantity });

// Remove item
document.getElementById('cart').removeLine(lineId);
```

#### Custom Loading States

Add placeholder content while Shopify data loads:

```html
<shopify-context type="product" handle={productHandle}>
  <template>
    <!-- Actual content -->
  </template>

  <!-- Shown while loading -->
  <div class="placeholder">
    <div class="skeleton-box"></div>
  </div>
</shopify-context>
```

<a name="troubleshooting"></a>

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

#### Authentication Errors (401)

**Problem:** "401 Unauthorized" or "Invalid access token"

**Solutions:**
- Verify your access token is correct in `src/data/shopify.ts`
- Ensure the Headless app is installed on your Shopify store
- Check that you're using the **public** access token (not private)
- Verify your store URL is correct (format: `https://your-store.myshopify.com/`)

#### No Products Showing

**Problem:** Product list is empty

**Solutions:**
- Add products to your Shopify store (they must be published to the "Headless" channel)
- Check that products are available in your selected country
- Verify your Storefront API access scopes include `unauthenticated_read_product_listings`
- Open browser console and check for error messages

#### Filters Not Working 

**Problem:** Filter buttons don't appear or don't filter products

**Solutions:**
- Install the **Search & Discovery** app from Shopify admin
- Configure which filters to enable (price, vendor, tags, etc.)
- Filters are only available with adequate product metadata
- Basic Plan or higher required for some filter types

#### Empty Cart or Cart Not Working

**Problem:** Cart appears empty after adding items

**Solutions:**
- Ensure products have images (Shopify requires images for cart items)
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify the `<shopify-store>` wrapper is in place
- Clear browser cache and cookies

#### Images Not Loading

**Problem:** Product images don't display

**Solutions:**
- Verify products have images uploaded in Shopify admin
- Check the `query` attribute on `<shopify-media>` components
- Ensure images are published to the Headless channel
- Check network tab for 404 errors

#### Web Components Not Defined

**Problem:** "Custom element not defined" errors

**Solutions:**
- Ensure the Storefront Web Components script is loaded
- Check that `<shopify-store>` wraps your components
- Wait for the page to fully load before accessing components
- Verify you're not blocking third-party scripts

## Customizing the Project

This kit includes Decap CMS for blog content management. This section covers CMS configuration and customization options.

<a name="configuringDecapCms"></a>

### Configuring Decap CMS

In `public/admin/`, you'll find a `config.yml` file which contains the configuration for the blog. While this project is set up to work with a blog out of the box, you are welcome to make changes using
<a href="https://decapcms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/#configuration">Decap CMS'</a> documentation.

Blog content lives in `/src/content/blog` in the form of markdown files, with a front matter similar to that of the pages. MDX files can also be used if you want to include JSX components. The title, description, and tags are defined in the frontmatter of the markdown. The permalink will be the same as the file name.

Files uploaded through the dashboard's media library will be stored in `src/assets/images/blog` so that they can be accessed and optimised by Astro components if you wish.

You can access the blog via navigating to the `/admin` path on the deployed site and entering your decapbridge admin credentials. All blog content can be easily created, updated and deleted via this admin panel, and is the very system that your clients can use to manage their website without your involvement.

Everything on the blog should be fairly intuitive, but feel free to experiment with using this panel first. With this kit, you can add _featured_ to the comma-separated list of tags to have them show up as so in the frontend.

### Styling the Decap preview pane

This template includes custom styles for the Decap CMS preview pane, so that blog posts in the admin dashboard look similar to the live site.

**How it works:**

- The preview styles are defined in `public/admin/decap-preview-styles.css`.
- The CMS preview script in `src/pages/admin.astro`:
  - pulls the props from the collection
  - creates the DOM elements
  - registers these elements and styles for the preview panel to use

**How to update or customize:**

- Edit `public/admin/decap-preview-styles.css` and the preview pane script in `src/pages/admin.astro` to match your site's branding or layout changes.
- Use Decap's documentation on [customizing the preview pane](https://decapcms.org/docs/customization/)

**Notes**

- The style sheet must be a CSS file
- The style sheet does not support nested CSS.

#### Adding local backend

If you want to be able to access the Decap dashboard in order to make content changes, you need to enable some local backend settings.

1. in `public/admin/config.yml`
   Add the local_backend setting

```diff
+ local_backend: true
```

2. in `package.json`
   We need to be able to run a local decap server in parallel to our astro dev. In order to do so, we need to:

a. install some packages and update the scripts. Run:
`npm install npm-run-all --save-dev`
`npm install decap-server`

b. update the scripts

```diff
"scripts": {
"astro": "astro dev",
+ "decap": "npx decap-server",
+ "dev": "npm-run-all --parallel astro decap",
},
```

Now, when `npm run dev` is run, a proxy server for the CMS is spun up on `localhost:8081`. That can often mean you run into errors if `localhost:8080` is already taken, so look out for that. You can locally access the blog via navigating to the `/admin` path (e.g. `http://localhost:4321/admin`). While running the local dev server, you won't need to login to access the admin dashboard.

### Removing Decap CMS

If you don't need a CMS for your project, you can easily remove Decap CMS using the included removal script.

#### When to Remove Decap CMS

- Building a static site with no content management needs
- Want to use local Content Collections without Decap
- Prefer a different CMS solution
- Simplifying the project for a specific use case

#### How to Remove

Run the removal script:

```bash
npm run remove-decap
```

The script will:
1. Ask for confirmation before proceeding
2. Ask if you want to remove blog content and configuration
   - Choose **yes** to completely remove blog functionality
   - Choose **no** to keep blog files for local Content Collections (without Decap)

#### Safety & Recovery

- **Files are moved, not deleted** - Everything goes to `scripts/deleted/`
- **Easy to restore** - Copy files back from `scripts/deleted/` if needed
- **Commit first** - Always commit changes before running the script

### Astro content collections

In `/src/content`, you will see a `config.ts` file. This is where you can configure [Astro Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/). This step is **not necessary** to run the blog with Decap CMS, but it will supercharge your Astro pages and content. Collections help to

- organize your documents,
- validate your frontmatter,
- provide automatic TypeScript type-safety for all of your content,
- use Astro's `<Image />` and `<Picture />` components with user-uplaoded images via the CMS.

This template already has Content Collections configured for immediate use of the blog content, but you could use them to power up the Portfolio or Gallery for example.

Content Collections can also be used on content that is not created via the CMS.


## Deployment

### Sitemap Configuration

This kit includes automatic sitemap generation for better SEO and search engine discoverability.

#### How It Works

**Static Pages:** The `@astrojs/sitemap` integration automatically discovers all static pages (home, about, blog, etc.) at build time.

**Product Pages:** A custom sitemap endpoint fetches all product handles from your Shopify store via the Storefront API and generates product URLs.

**Sitemap Index:** Both sitemaps are combined into a sitemap index for easy submission to search engines.

#### Setup

1. **Update your site URL** in `astro.config.mjs`:
   ```javascript
   const SITE_URL = "https://www.yourwebsite.com";
   ```

2. **Optional:** Change the shop route slug:
   ```javascript
   const SHOP_SLUG = "shop"; // Change if using different route
   ```

3. **Build your site:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

#### Generated Files

- `dist/sitemap-index.xml` - References both sitemaps
- `dist/sitemap-0.xml` - Static pages
- `dist/shop-sitemap.xml` - Product pages

#### Submitting to Search Engines

Submit `https://yoursite.com/sitemap-index.xml` to:
- Google Search Console
- Bing Webmaster Tools
- Other search engines

The sitemap updates automatically on each build with current products.

### Choosing a Shopify Plan for Your Client

When handing off the store to your client, they'll need to choose a Shopify plan. Here's what to recommend:

> [!NOTE]
> Plan features and prices current at the time of writing

**Starter Plan ($5/month)**
- Basic e-commerce functionality with buy buttons and checkout links
- Best for: Simple stores with few products, limited budget
- **Transaction fees:** 5% per transaction (when not using Shopify Payments)
- **Limitations:** No Collections, no discount codes, no custom domains

**Basic Plan ($39/month)** ⭐ 
- Full e-commerce platform with all essential features
- Best for: Most clients with 20+ products who want to grow
- **Transaction fees:** 1.5% per transaction (when not using Shopify Payments)
- **Includes:**
  - **Collections** - Organize products by category for better navigation
  - **Discount codes** - Run promotions and sales
  - **Custom domains** - Professional branding with client's own domain
  - **Unlimited products** - No restrictions on catalog size
  - **Gift cards** - Sell gift cards to customers
  - **Advanced reports** - Track sales and customer behavior

**Recommendation:** For most professional e-commerce sites, the Basic Plan is the better choice. The lower transaction fees often offset the higher monthly cost, and clients benefit from essential features like Collections and discount codes that improve the shopping experience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This kit now uses decapbridge.com for its authentication solution. If you still use Netlify Identity, please refer to [the Netlify Identity branch](https://github.com/CodeStitchOfficial/Intermediate-Astro-Decap-CMS/tree/deprecated---using-Netlify-Identity)

0. **Before** you deploy, ensure the astro.config.mjs, client.json, robots.txt, \_redirects have been filled out, and that any kit placeholders have been swapped out.

> [!TIP]
> If you are updating your kit from Netlify Identity to decapbridge.com:
>
> 1. Login to your Netlify account
> 2. Navigate to Projects/Your-Site
> 3. Navigate to Project Configuration/Identity and delete the Netlify Identity instance. This will delete your users as well. They will have to be re-created in decapbridge later.
> 4. In /src/pages/admin.astro, delete the Netlify Identity script

### On decapbridge.com:

1. Make sure that your repo is on Github and your site is deployed (doesn’t have to be Netlify) before moving on to the next step.
2. Navigate to https://decapbridge.com/ and create an account. It’s free.
3. Navigate to the dashboard and Create New Site. You see this screen:

![decapbridge.com dashboard](public/assets/readme-images/decapbridge-dashboard.png)

Fill in the 3 input fields:

- Github repository: it has to be in a `user-or-org/repository-name` format. e.g. `BuckyBuck135/testing-decapbridge`
- Github access token.
  To create a personal access token in GitHub, follow these steps:

  1. Log into your Github account.
  2. Click on your profile picture (top right) (not the repository profile), and click the “Settings” link.
  3. Scroll down and click the “Developer Settings” link.
  4. Click the GitHub “Personal access tokens” link and choose `fine-grained tokens`
  5. Click the “Generate new token” button and provide your password again if required.
  6. Provide a name for the GitHub personal access token in the “Note” field.
  7. Set the access token’s “expiration” timeout to “No expiration.”
  8. Set the “Repository access” to the desired repository only.
  9. Set the “Permissions / Repository permissions” to **read-write access** for this repository's **Contents** and **Pull requests. (**This is needed by DecapCMS to read your markdown, and write new content via Pull Requests.)
  10. Click “Generate token.”, double check the permissions and click the Generate Token button
  11. **Make sure to copy your GitHub Personal Access Token now as you will not be able to see this again.**

      ![The Permissions settings](public/assets/readme-images/github-permissions.png)

  12. Double check your permissions before generating the token. It must have read and write access to Contents and Pull Requests.

- Decap CMS URL: provide the (deployed) URL of the Decap CMS dashboard. e.g [`https://testing-decapbridge.netlify.app/admin/#/`](https://testing-decapbridge.netlify.app/admin/#/)

### On your CS Decap kit:

1. In `/public/admin/config.yml`, edit the `backend` Decap config to paste in the snippet provided by the [DecapBridge.com](http://DecapBridge.com) dashboard. It should look something like this:

```yaml
# Use DecapBridge auth (required)
backend:
  name: git-gateway
  repo: BuckyBuck135/testing-decapbridge # provided by decapbridge
  branch: main
  identity_url: https://auth.decapbridge.com/sites/5605bbe7-08f2-4ce5-bce2-7d97def08bed # provided by decapbridge
  gateway_url: https://gateway.decapbridge.com # provided by decapbridge

  # Quickly see who did what (optional)
  commit_messages:
    create: Create {{collection}} “{{slug}}” - {{author-name}} <{{author-login}}> via DecapBridge
    update: Update {{collection}} “{{slug}}” - {{author-name}} <{{author-login}}> via DecapBridge
    delete: Delete {{collection}} “{{slug}}” - {{author-name}} <{{author-login}}> via DecapBridge
    uploadMedia: Upload “{{path}}” - {{author-name}} <{{author-login}}> via DecapBridge
    deleteMedia: Delete “{{path}}” - {{author-name}} <{{author-login}}> via DecapBridge
    openAuthoring: Message {{message}} - {{author-name}} <{{author-login}}> via DecapBridge

# Better Decap + Bridge logo (optional)
logo_url: https://decapbridge.com/decapcms-with-bridge.svg

# Add site links in DecapCMS (optional)
site_url: https://testing-decapbridge.netlify.app
```

2. Push changes to the repo and test the authentication system. As the admin of the site, your login credentials to access the Decap dashboard are the same as your decapbridge.com credentials.
3. Invite your client from your decapbridge dashboard. This will create a decapbridge collaborator account for them. From there, they will be able to access their Decap dashboard, reset their password etc.
